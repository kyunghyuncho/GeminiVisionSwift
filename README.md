# GeminiVisionSwift

i decided to create a more native Mac App of an earlier version (https://github.com/kyunghyuncho/gemini-vision-app). it is again fully vibe-coded with help mainly from `gemini-2.5-pro`. i never coded a Mac App before, nor have i even tried swift before. so, please understand the limitations.
