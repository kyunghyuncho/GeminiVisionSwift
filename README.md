# GeminiVisionSwift

i decided to create a more native Mac App of an earlier version (https://github.com/kyunghyuncho/gemini-vision-app). it is again fully vibe-coded with help mainly from `gemini-2.5-pro`. i never coded a Mac App before, nor have i even tried swift before. so, please understand the limitations.

if you want to try out a pre-built app, get the latest version from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17J4WY0840HSt36v-0FK9kthQUqlNGEb9?usp=drive_link.
